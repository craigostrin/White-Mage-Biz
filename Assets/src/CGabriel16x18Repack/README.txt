This is a repack by Jorhlok of Charles Gabriel's mostly 16x18 character sprites and 48x48 portraits. Some of the characters go over the 16x18 "limit" so I padded out all the sprites to 24x24 with a transparent background and compiled 13 sprite sheets into 2. The character portraits are from the updated versions but I altered the irises to look more like the originals because that is my preference. I also fixed a couple of errors such as the female Dark Knight missing headgear in the third walking sprite facing up. You can credit me, too, if you wish but you absolutely must credit Charles Gabriel as per the copyright license.

All of the sprites facing left were just flipped from facing right so I didn't include them. I also didn't include the last frame of punching because it was the same as the previous frame and the first frame of casting because it was the same as standing (2nd sprite). The last three cast frames facing up all seem to be identical but I still included those because it would make holes in the sprite sheet.
